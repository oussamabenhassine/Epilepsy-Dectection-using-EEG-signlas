# Epilepsy-Dectection-using-EEG-signlas
# Analysis of EEG signals and application of Machine and Deep learning models to predict the epilepsy




* reading  the .edf files and convert them into .csv files
* for the data preprocessing (ML) we apply the Welch and Wavlets methods in order to exract important features for the machine learning modeling
* for the Dimensionality_Reduction we used 2 methods : 1) Feature Importances with Random Forests
                                                       2) Sequential Feature Selector
   and we continue with 26 features
* in the 'Data_Preprocessing_ML' notebook we makeed all the files in the same dimension to be able to apply Deep learning Models
