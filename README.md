Dataset: The TUH EEG Epilepsy Corpus (TUEP)

* reading  the .edf files and convert them into .csv files
* for the data preprocessing (ML) we apply the Welch and Wavlets methods in order to exract important features for the machine learning modeling
* in the 'Data_Preprocessing_ML' notebook we makeed all the files in the same dimension to be able to apply Deep learning Models
