# Epilepsy-Dectection-using-EEG-signlas
Analysis of EEG signals and application of Machine and Deep learning models to predict the epilepsy

read the .edf files and convert them into .csv files
for the data preprocessing (ML) we apply the Welch and Wavlets methods in order to exract important features for the machine learning modeling
